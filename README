Hi there! Lithium is a programming language that was designed by a self-confessed amateur and subsequently combines too many ill-considered ideas into the one monolithic package. It is highly recommended for those who appreciate sarcasm in README files, those who don't like parentheses and braces but love verbosity and whitespace, those who are prepared to make some coffee while waiting for their program to run (not just compile), and those who think that Lisp, [Haskell](https://xkcd.com/1312/) and Smalltalk aren't flawed enough to be used in production.

A simple "Hello, World!" program in Lithium looks pretty similar to every other "Hello, world!" program ever written:
```lithium
print("Hello, World!")
```

Perhaps you'd like to see a web server? Here's how you make one of those (adapted from the [Node.js About page](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)):
```lithium
import {Server} from 'http'

constant server: new Server()

async for [request, response] on server
	response.statusCode: 200
	response.headers["Content-Type"]: "text/plain"
	response.end("Hello, World!")

server.listen(80)

print('Server running at http://${server.hostname}:${server.port}/')
```
The above code imported the `Server` class from the `http` package, initialised a new server, created an asynchronous for loop that observed requests made to the server and responded with "Hello, World!", and then told the server to listen on port 80.

## Installation

Lithium currently lives on [npmjs.org](npm). You can install it like this:
```bash
npm install -g <package name>
```
The `lithium` command will now be available, and a JavaScript-based compiler/interpreter will be available. See below for more on compilers and interpreters.

For more details on installing Lithium, see [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

## Docs

There are several types of documentation in this repository, each serving a different need:
* The [**`docs`** directory](./docs/index.md) contains documentation for programmers, covering syntax, the standard library, authoring packages, using compilers and interpreters, as well as frequently asked questions and further resources. This should be your first port of call.
* The [source code of the standard library](./lib/README.md) is embedded in Markdown documents, with the code extracted from these annotated documents before being run. These annotations are more for browsing and procrastination than for reference.
* The [**`spec`** directory](./spec/index.md) contains documentation for people seeking to implement the Lithium language, i.e. compiler and interpreter authors.  

## Usage

Running the following at the command line will get you a REPL:
```bash
lithium
```

Running a Lithium file is done like this:
```bash
lithium run program.li
```

Further command line help is available by running the following:
```bash
lithium help
```
